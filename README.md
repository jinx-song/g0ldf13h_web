# g0ldf13h_web

Food & travel content site — landing page plus Food and Travel sections.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder (e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8000`) and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Host on GitHub (use the repo as the domain)

The site is static and uses relative links, so it works on **GitHub Pages** at:

**`https://<your-username>.github.io/g0ldf13h_web/`**

1. Push this repo to GitHub (if you haven’t already).
2. In the repo on GitHub: **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Choose branch **main** (or your default branch) and folder **/ (root)**.
5. Click **Save**. After a minute or two, the site will be live at the URL above.

You can share that URL as the site’s “domain” (e.g. in your profile or links).
